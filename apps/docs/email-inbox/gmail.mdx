3. **Verification Process**
   - Sometimes, a verification email is sent by Gmail to confirm the forwarding address.
   - In your Chatvolt inbox, locate and open the confirmation email from Gmail. Follow the verification link within this email to complete the process.
4. **Create an Email Filter**
   - To ensure all emails are correctly forwarded to Chatvolt, you'll need to set up a filter.
   - Again, click "See all settings" in the top right, then navigate to "Filters and Blocked Addresses" and select "Create a new filter."
   - In the filter settings, enter your official support email in the "To" field. If you've verified a sender email address with Chatvolt, ensure it matches the address you're inputting here.
   - Proceed to "Create filter."
