This Privacy Statement explains how our organization uses the personal data we collect from you and why. If you have any questions after reading this Privacy Statement, please feel free to contact us at support@chatvolt.ai.

To avoid any misunderstandings, we would like to clarify that this Privacy Statement applies to the processing of personal data from:

- Creators: the person who creates and distributes Chatvolt
- Website visitors: people who visit our marketing landing page

Chatvolt is the provider of this service and not the owner of the collected data. The creator (the person who created the chatbot) is responsible for the data they collect and, therefore, is the data controller of the respondent's data.

## **2. What Data We Collect**
Information we collect from Creators (you have a Chatvolt account and are using our service) or Website Visitors (you are visiting our website).

- Electronic identification data: including IP address, device and browser data, and location data;

- Chatbot data: We store your chatbot data for you and provide tools for you to use in relation to this data.

## **3. How We Use Your Data**

## **5. Data Retention**
If you are a Chatvolt chatbot creator, we do not delete the data in your account. You are responsible for the duration you store the data. You can delete data in your Chatvolt account. If you are a respondent, you will need to ask the creator how long your responses will be stored on Chatvolt.

We honor all deletions, and all chatbot data that has been deleted by the chatbot creator are permanently deleted from our backups within 90 days.

## **6. Data Obtained Through Google Workspace APIs (Google Drive)**
Users of our application, Chatvolt, use the Google Workspace APIs to develop, improve, or train custom AI agent models directly on our platform.
We are committed to ensuring that the data obtained through the Google Workspace APIs is used exclusively to provide and improve the results of the AI agents created by the users themselves.
We do not retain user data from these APIs for any purposes related to the development, improvement, or training of AI or machine learning models that are not directly linked to the specific needs of the users.

## **7. Your Data Protection Rights**
As our Privacy Policy states, if you have submitted your personal data through a Chatvolt chatbot, the creator of that chatbot is responsible for that data. Chatvolt only processes this data on behalf of the creator. Chatvolt creators can exercise their rights directly with us, but respondents must contact the person or organization that created the chatbot. If this is not possible, please contact us. We will assist in any way we can.
