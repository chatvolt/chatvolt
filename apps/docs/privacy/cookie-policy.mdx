### **What are cookies?**
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by the websites you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. These cookies contain a unique code that allows us to recognize your browser during your visit to our site (called ‘session’ cookies) or on repeated visits later (called ‘permanent’ cookies). The content of a cookie generally includes the name of the server that placed the cookie, an expiry date, and a unique numerical code.

Based on your browsing habits, a cookie remembers your preferences. These personal interests are stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies facilitate the interaction between you, the visitor, and the website, making it easier and faster, and helping you navigate between different parts of a website. Cookies are also used to make the content or advertising on a website more relevant to the visitor. Ultimately, a cookie ensures that the content is adaptable to your taste and personal needs.

### **What types of cookies does Chatvolt use?**
**Necessary Cookies:** Certain cookies are necessary for the website to function properly and remain secure. For example, we use cookies to authenticate you. When you access our site, authentication cookies are set up, which allow us to know who you are during a browsing session. We need to load essential cookies for legitimate interests pursued by us in delivering the essential functionality of our Sites to you.

**Analytical Cookies:** Analytical cookies collect information about your use of our site and allow us to improve how it works. We use Google Analytics to track user behavior on our product (only when you are logged in). We do not use Google Analytics to track forms made with Chatvolt. We use a self-hosted, privacy-focused web analytics solution that is GDPR compliant and does not use cookies in the tracking code.
