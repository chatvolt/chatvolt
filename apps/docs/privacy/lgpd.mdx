This page does not constitute legal advice. Please determine with your legal advisor how the LGPD applies to your business.

### **What is the LGPD?**
The General Data Protection Law (LGPD) is a Brazilian privacy law that allows citizens and residents in Brazil to have access to and control over their personal data.

### **Does this affect you?**
If your company is based in Brazil, or you process the personal data of individuals in Brazil, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) affects you.

### **Is Chatvolt compliant with the LGPD?**
Chatvolt is based in Brazil and complies with the LGPD framework.

### **The measures we have taken**
Our privacy policy provides more information about what data we collect, data retention and transfers, and outlines your data protection rights.
All Chatvolt chatbot data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and stored in the USA.
Data Accessibility: You have full control over the information you collect, store, and manage with Chatvolt.

### **What happens with form data?**
Chatvolt is the provider of a form service, and not the owner of the responses collected from the forms.

The creator of the chatbot is responsible for the data they collect... and therefore, is the data controller for the respondent's data. Chatvolt is the processor and stores information on behalf of chatbot creators. As long as your account is active, you (as the creator of the chatbot) have full control over the data you collect, and the period of time you store the data. You can delete or export form responses from your account if necessary. We honor all deletions, and all form data that have been deleted by you are permanently removed from our backups within 90 days.

### **How do you use my personal data?**
Chatvolt acts as the data controller in the relationship between Chatvolt and our customers (chatbot creators), for the personal information you provide us to use our service (registration information, for example). Chatvolt does not sell personal data to third parties nor does it use them for marketing purposes or to serve ads.

We only share your information with our service providers who help us operate our business, in which case these third parties are obligated to comply with the LGPD framework.
