## **Dispute Resolution**
**Informal Negotiations**

Should any controversy, litigation, issue, doubt, or disagreement of any nature arise

("Dispute"), involving any of the Parties, directly or indirectly related to this term, including its interpretation, existence, validity, effectiveness, performance, and/or termination, the Parties shall endeavor their best efforts to amicably resolve the Dispute. Should any Dispute occur, the interested Party in its resolution shall send a written notification ("Dispute Notification"), with the purpose of initiating negotiations for the amicable resolution of the Dispute.

If the Parties fail to amicably resolve the Dispute within 30 (thirty) days from the receipt of the Dispute Notification for the friendly negotiations provided in the above Clause, the Involved Parties agree to submit it to arbitration, to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Commercial Association of Paraná's Mediation and Arbitration Chamber ("Chamber") in force at the date of the arbitration.

a. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the norms and procedures of the Chamber in force at the time the arbitration procedure is initiated.

The arbitral tribunal ("Arbitral Tribunal") shall consist of a single arbitrator to be appointed by mutual agreement between the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree on such appointment, within 30 (thirty) days from the date set for such measure, the president of the Chamber shall appoint the arbitrator, in the manner established in its regulations.

Any omissions, refusals, litigations, doubts, and disagreements regarding the arbitrator's appointment by the Parties shall be resolved by the Chamber.

The arbitration shall be based in the Capital of the State of São Paulo, where the arbitral sentence will be pronounced, although the Arbitral Tribunal, for motivated reasons, may designate the performance of specific acts in other locations.

The arbitration shall be of law, in the Portuguese language, applying the rules and principles of the legal system of the Federative Republic of Brazil, and the arbitrator is prohibited from deciding by equity.

The arbitration shall be concluded within a maximum period of 6 (six) months, which may be extended for motivated reasons by the Arbitral Tribunal.

The decisions of the arbitration shall be final and definitive, requiring no judicial ratification and no appeal against them is allowed, except for requests for correction and clarifications to the Arbitral Tribunal as provided in Art. 30 of Law No. 9.307/96.

Before the installation of the Arbitral Tribunal, any of the Parties may request precautionary measures or anticipatory relief from the Judiciary, being certain that any request for precautionary measure or anticipatory relief by the Judiciary will not affect the existence, validity, and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement, nor will it represent a waiver regarding the need to submit the Dispute to arbitration. After the installation of the Arbitral Tribunal, requests for precautionary measures or anticipatory relief should be directed to the Arbitral Tribunal.

For (i) precautionary measures and anticipatory relief prior to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal; (ii) the execution of the decisions of the Arbitral Tribunal, including the final sentence and any partial sentence; (iii) any annulment action founded on Art. 32 of Law No. 9.307/96; and (iv) Disputes which by force of Brazilian legislation cannot be submitted to arbitration, the Forum of the District of São Paulo, State of São Paulo, is elected as the sole competent authority, renouncing all others, no matter how special or privileged they may be.

**Restrictions**

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration**

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
