[Chatvolt](http://chatvolt.ai) is powered by large language models (LLM) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
As powerful as LLMs are, they can sometimes produce inaccurate or out-of-scope answers. This is called “hallucination”.

[Chatvolt](http://chatvolt.ai) provides multiple mechanisms/features to decrease hallucination.

### Avoid duplicated content

Adding multiple times the same documents/information, even translated should be avoided.
Duplicated content can impact the Chatbot's performance.
It is best to add a piece of information only once, whatever the language

### Use GPT-4

Using GPT-4 can help to generate more accurate and truthful responses.
This model is also more respectful of the instructions given in a prompt.

The downside of GPT-4 is that it costs more credits and is slower than GPT-3.5-turbo.
