Users are able to upload files during a conversation with an agent. This feature is useful when users need to share files with agents or with human operators.

<Note>
  Files uploaded during a conversation are not accessible to other
  conversations. To extend the Agent's knowledge for all conversations, use a
  [Datastore](/datastore) instead.
